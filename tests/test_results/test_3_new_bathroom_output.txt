Test: test_3_new_bathroom
Transcript: We're building an extension and want to add a new bathroom, roughly 5m². It'll need full plumbing installation, tiling, a shower enclosure, wall-hung toilet, and floating vanity. We haven't picked out materials yet, so would love recommendations. Our main concern is staying within a mid-range budget. Located in Nice.
