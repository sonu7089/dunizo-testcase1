Test: test_2_dual_bathrooms
Transcript: We have two bathrooms we want to renovate. First is the master bath — around 6m². We'd like to install a freestanding tub, redo the tiling completely, and upgrade the lighting. The second is a smaller ensuite — just 2.5m². We need to replace the shower, update the vanity, and fix some minor water damage on the ceiling. We'd like both to have a cohesive look. Budget is flexible, depending on design. We're based in Toulouse.
