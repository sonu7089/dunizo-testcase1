Test: test_1_guest_bathroom
Transcript: We're looking to upgrade our guest bathroom — it's about 3.5 square meters. We'd like to remove the existing bathtub and replace it with a walk-in shower. The sink and mirror cabinet need to be modernized too. We'd also appreciate help choosing space-saving fixtures. Budget is moderate. We're in Lyon.
